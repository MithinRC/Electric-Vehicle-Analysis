# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project provides an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for analyzing the adoption and trends of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** across different regions, manufacturers, and models. The analysis covers **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**, offering insights into market size, technology improvements, and consumer preferences.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to:
1. **Understand the EV landscape** by analyzing total vehicles (BEVs & PHEVs).
2. **Measure technological progress** through average electric range.
3. **Evaluate BEV dominance** by calculating total BEVs and their market share.
4. **Analyze PHEV presence** by determining total PHEVs and their percentage of the EV market.
5. **Visualize key adoption patterns** by year, state, make, and model.
6. **Assess CAFV Eligibility** to understand the impact of clean fuel incentives.
